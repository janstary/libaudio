au_check(info)

read an write _frames_ (as opposed to samples)

manpage:
	document au_info()

au_info:
	display num of samples/frames too
	(usualy this will go into the header)

pcm:
	increment file->frames and file->samples when writing
	int to float: (*samples++ * 1.0) / INT8_MAX) can be below then -1
	float to int: *samples++ = RFLE(p) * INT8_MAX will never be -1
		So we differ between >0 and <0, but is it worth it?
		libsndfile doesn't care
	support 24 bit

test suite
	see what libsndfile/tests does, pcm* in particular
	all conversions, in both directions, watch the diffs

more encodings:
	log PCM: alaw, mulaw
	FLAC, OPUS, Ogg Vorbis

audio.h declares everything
	cleanly split the public interface and the private parts
	and declare only the public stuff in audio.h

large file support?
	what does libsndfile do on 32 bit systems?

support tags?
